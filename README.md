# Jekyll_Filter
A Windows Forms app to get web pages and Word documents into a Jekyll Blog site and Markdown. Uses Pandoc.

This project was started as a component of the repository https://github.com/djaus2/djaus2.github.io.

That project is a Jekyll site but has teh first version of this in a subfolder (Filter). The above site was then migrated to Azure Devops where the FilterWf project was extended extensively  and this is the reseult.

The new (DevOps and Azure hosted) site is now at https://davidjones.sportronics.com.au
